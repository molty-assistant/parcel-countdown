# Privacy Policy — Parcel Countdown

**Last updated:** 8 February 2026

---

## Overview

Parcel Countdown is a simple delivery countdown app. Your privacy is fundamental to how this app is designed.

**The short version:** All your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or transmit anything.

---

## Data Storage

All data you enter into Parcel Countdown (parcel names, delivery dates, tracking URLs, and notes) is stored **locally on your device only**, using on-device storage. This data is never sent to any server, cloud service, or third party.

If you delete the app, all data is permanently removed.

---

## Data Collection

Parcel Countdown does **not** collect any data. Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected
- **No usage analytics** or telemetry
- **No crash reporting** to external services
- **No advertising** or ad tracking
- **No cookies** or tracking technologies
- **No network requests** of any kind — the app works entirely offline

---

## Third-Party Services

Parcel Countdown does **not** use any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs. There are no analytics providers, advertising networks, or cloud services integrated into the app.

The only network activity that may occur is if you tap a tracking URL you've saved — this opens the link in your device's browser, outside of the app.

## Children's Privacy

Parcel Countdown does not collect any data from anyone, including children. The app is suitable for users of all ages.
